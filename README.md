# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 — C Solutions

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2025** repository!  
This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2025 puzzles, written in **C** and organized by day.

Advent of Code is an **online coding challenge** that releases a new programming puzzle every day during December. Each puzzle has two parts, and solving them helps build problem-solving and algorithm skills.
